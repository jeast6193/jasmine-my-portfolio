# Portfolio Assignmednt
My portfolio assignment incldues an about me section to give users some insight into who I am, a protfolio page showcasing different projects that I have worked on, and  a contact page for users to get in touch with me.

# Installation
There were a lot of steps that had to be done in order to make my portfolio functional and user friendly. Here are the the steps I took in order to achieve this outcome:
* Used bootstrap in the HTML 
* Made sure all of my nav bar links were functional
* Used semantic HTML
* Created a background image
* Added a profile picture
* Changed the color of my text

# Usage
My protfolio is pretty starightforward as far its usage is concerend. Every link you click will direct you to exactly what you are looking for.
